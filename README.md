# Solve Sudoku - Learning Python through writing a Solver for Sudoku

I created this project to help me with learning Python.
While I didn't write the code in the most efficient manner or the most logical manner, my goal was to learn Python.
So, I set otu to use this project to learn more about Classes, Methods, and Lists (aka, Arrays).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Requires the "random" library; otherwise, it is a stand alone program.

### Installing

Get a copy of the Solve-Sudoku repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/king-md/Solve-Sudoku.git
```

Copy the Solve-Sudoku.py program to the directory where you want to run it from.

```
Windows: copy src\Solve-Sudoku.py C:\DESTINATION

Linux: cp -p src/Solve-Sudoku.py /home/user/bin/.
```
